\section{Professional Disaster Summary}

\textbf{18+ years of making expensive mistakes} so you don't have to. Specialized in learning the hard way about enterprise architecture, team leadership, and why "it works on my machine" isn't a deployment strategy. Currently helping LBBW avoid the same architectural disasters I've personally experienced.

\textbf{Core Incompetencies Developed Through Failure:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Overengineering Expert:} Learned to build simple solutions after creating impossibly complex ones first
\item \textbf{Microservices Skeptic:} Discovered the hard way why they're not always the answer (Sorry, Trusted Shops)
\item \textbf{Management Survivor:} Promoted to Head of Development without leadership training—learned empathy through failure
\item \textbf{Technology Hype Victim:} Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch because "ElasticSearch seemed too exotic"
\item \textbf{Kubernetes Critic:} Still believe it's overcomplicated after years of wrestling with it
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Greatest Hits of Professional Humility:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Built a 1000+ test suite that initially took 45 minutes to run
\item Managed a team of 7 developers while learning management on the job
\item Spent 3 years as sole developer on middleware that processed 10M records (because I said "sure, I can handle that")
\item Convinced a bank to let me modernize their IT architecture (they're still recovering)
\end{itemize}

\section{Recent Learning Experiences (2021-2024)}

\subsection{LBBW: Banking on Disaster (Nov 2024—Present)}

\textbf{Current Challenge:} Helping Germany's major state bank modernize IT architecture after volunteering to assess "hundreds of legacy applications." Turns out saying "I can evaluate your entire application portfolio" was optimistic.

\textbf{Learning Opportunities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scope Estimation Failure:} Confidently assessed migration complexity, then discovered applications built in technologies I'd never heard of
\item \textbf{Enterprise Reality Check:} My "simple" architectural solutions meet banking compliance requirements approximately like a bicycle meets Formula 1 regulations
\item \textbf{Platform Evangelism:} Enthusiastically promoted Azure migration to teams already traumatized by previous "cloud transformations"
\item \textbf{Template Obsession:} Created beautiful Solution Design Templates that work perfectly in theory
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Union Investment: The Great SCS Experiment (Oct 2021—Dec 2024)}

\textbf{3-year transformation of a "simple" B2B platform} that somehow required event-driven architecture, microfrontends, and enough documentation to deforest a small country.

\textbf{Spectacular Learning Moments:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Architectural Overengineering:} Turned a straightforward portal into 8 Self-contained Systems because "domain boundaries"
\item \textbf{Framework Addiction:} Built a custom microfrontend toolkit when buying an existing solution was clearly the sensible option
\item \textbf{Testing Perfectionism:} Achieved 1000+ tests that initially took 45 minutes to run—learned about parallel execution through exhaustion
\item \textbf{Technology Evangelism:} Convinced team to adopt Web Components standard that 3 people worldwide actually understood
\item \textbf{Search Complexity:} Designed event-driven search across 8 domains when a simple database query might have sufficed
\item \textbf{360° Feedback Humility:} Learned that "explaining things too technically" means "nobody understands what you're talking about"
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Redemption Arc:} Eventually delivered working platform with 99.9\% uptime, but not before questioning every architectural decision at 3 AM.

\subsection{Saloodo!/DHL: Solo Middleware Madness (Dec 2021—Nov 2024)}

\textbf{Accepted part-time role} synchronizing 10 million records between systems because "how hard could it be?"

\textbf{Isolation Learning:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Architecture Decisions in Vacuum:} Made every decision alone, including some spectacularly wrong ones
\item \textbf{Database Schema Horror:} Discovered that real-world data doesn't follow logical patterns—or any patterns
\item \textbf{Scale Assumption Failure:} Built solution for "some records" that turned out to be 10 million records
\item \textbf{Golang Overconfidence:} Chose Golang for first production use because "how different can it be from Java?"
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Accidental Success:} Achieved 100\% uptime through over-engineering fault tolerance.

\subsection{Trusted Shops: Microservices Reality Check (Aug 2018—Oct 2019)}

\textbf{First encounter with real microservices architecture}—learned why they're not always the panacea consultants promise.

\textbf{Disillusionment Journey:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Microservices Mythology:} Discovered that simple changes require modifying 6 different services owned by 4 different teams
\item \textbf{Service Mesh Complexity:} Realized that network calls are not method calls, especially when they fail
\item \textbf{Distributed Testing Nightmare:} Learned that integration testing across microservices makes unit testing look trivial
\item \textbf{DevOps Learning Curve:} Became reluctant Kubernetes expert while secretly longing for simpler deployment options
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Valuable Skepticism Developed:} Now approach microservices recommendations with healthy suspicion.

\section{Earlier Educational Disasters (2007-2021)}

\subsection{werkenntwen: Management Learning Laboratory (2007-2014)}

\textbf{Promoted to Head of Development} at Germany's social network without management training—learned leadership through spectacular failures.

\textbf{Leadership Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Technical Manager Fallacy:} Assumed coding skills would automatically translate to people management
\item \textbf{Authority Confusion:} Oscillated between micromanagement and complete hands-off approaches
\item \textbf{Technology Decision Trauma:} Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch because "ElasticSearch seemed too exotic"—platform later migrated to ElasticSearch, validating that I should have been more adventurous
\item \textbf{Scaling Incompetence:} Learned vertical/horizontal partitioning through production database disasters
\item \textbf{Team Building Naivety:} Discovered that hiring "smart people" doesn't automatically create effective teams
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Character Development:} Evolved from technical dictator to collaborative leader through necessity and humility.

\subsection{Early Freelancing: Consultant Credibility Crisis (2014-2017)}

\textbf{Transition from employee to consultant} revealed gaps between confidence and competence.

\textbf{Learning Opportunities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Docker Complexity Shock:} First encounter with Kubernetes convinced me it was overcomplicated (still maintain this position)
\item \textbf{Contract Testing Evangelism:} Became Pact framework advocate after experiencing integration hell
\item \textbf{CI/CD Religious Conversion:} Learned DevOps importance through deployment disasters
\item \textbf{Client Expectation Management:} Discovered that "it should be simple" and "it is simple" are different statements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Atlassian Marketplace: Product Owner Illusions (2016-2023)}

\textbf{Built commercial add-ons} for Bamboo CI/CD—learned product management through customer complaints.

\textbf{Business Reality Education:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Market Size Misjudgment:} Built products for declining platform (Bamboo Server) while world moved to cloud
\item \textbf{Feature Creep Addiction:} Added complexity instead of solving core problems elegantly
\item \textbf{Customer Communication Avoidance:} Learned importance of customer feedback by initially ignoring it
\item \textbf{Technical Debt Accumulation:} Maintained Java codebase across multiple Atlassian API changes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sustainable Revenue Achievement:} Despite mistakes, maintained 83 customers across 15 countries for 7 years.

\section{Personal Projects: Hobby Disasters}

\subsection{Crypto-Arbitrage Trading Bot (2015)}
\textbf{Built automated Bitcoin trading system} during spare time—learned about market efficiency through losses.

\textbf{Algorithmic Trading Education:} Discovered that market inefficiencies disappear faster than development cycles.

\subsection{Jenkins-GitHub Integration PoC (2018)}
\textbf{Multi-tenant Jenkins automation} using Google Cloud and Firebase—learned about infrastructure complexity.

\textbf{Scope Creep Mastery:} Turned simple webhook into distributed system spanning 4 technologies.

\section{Educational Struggles \& Career Interruptions}

\subsection{University of Koblenz-Landau: Extended Learning Program (2004-2012)}

\textbf{Computer Science Diploma} that took 8 years instead of 5—learned time management through necessity.

\textbf{Academic Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Work-Study Balance Disaster:} Attempted full-time work while completing degree
\item \textbf{Perfectionism Paralysis:} Spent excessive time on assignments seeking perfection over completion
\item \textbf{Time Management Illusion:} Consistently underestimated project completion times
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final Grade:} Magna Cum Laude (possibly due to examiner sympathy for extended effort).

\subsection{Professional Development Gaps}

\textbf{Skills Learned the Hard Way:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Project Management:} Through scope creep disasters
\item \textbf{Client Communication:} Through misaligned expectations
\item \textbf{Team Leadership:} Through management failures
\item \textbf{Technology Selection:} Through production failures
\item \textbf{Architecture Design:} Through overengineering episodes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategic Career Breaks}

\textbf{Parental Leave (Apr 2020—Sep 2021):} Combined COVID-19 project scarcity with family time—learned that forced breaks can be beneficial.

\textbf{Travel Break (Aug—Dec 2015):} Extended exploration period—learned that stepping away from code occasionally provides perspective.

\textbf{Military Service (2003-2004):} Mandatory German military service—learned that software development is preferable to early morning exercises.

\section{Technical Skill Deficiencies \& Learning Methodology}

\textbf{Programming Languages:} Java (18y of making elegant mistakes), Golang (4y of fighting the compiler), PHP (8y of security vulnerabilities), TypeScript (adequate for frontend integration failures)

\textbf{Architecture Patterns:} Expert in overengineering microservices, Self-contained Systems, and event-driven architectures that could have been simple REST APIs

\textbf{Cloud Platforms:} AWS (7y of expensive experiments), Azure (4y of vendor lock-in), GCP (sufficient for comparison disappointments)

\textbf{Leadership Experience:} Team management through trial and error, agile coaching through ceremony confusion, stakeholder management through communication disasters

\section{Current Status \& Future Failure Opportunities}

\textbf{Professional Motto:} "Failing forward since 2007"

\textbf{Available for:} Architecture consulting (with realistic timelines), team leadership (with management training), and technical mentoring (with humility)

\textbf{Expertise Disclaimer:} All skills developed through practical failure experience. Success not guaranteed, but learning opportunities abundant.
