\sectionheader{Professional Disclaimer}

\textbf{18+ years} of making interesting technology choices, building things the hard way, and discovering why ``it depends'' is the most honest answer in software engineering. Currently helping LBBW modernize their IT while secretly wondering if we're all just moving complexity around like furniture in a burning house.

\textbf{Motto:} ``Crafting solutions that thrive today and tomorrow'' (though yesterday's solutions are still mysteriously running in production somewhere).

\sectionheader{Greatest Learning Experiences}

\textbf{The Kubernetes Skeptic:} Spent considerable time with Kubernetes only to conclude it's ``too complex for both operations and development teams.'' Apparently suggesting hyperscaler-managed services over K8s makes you unpopular at DevOps meetups.

\textbf{Microservices Reality Check:} At Trusted Shops, encountered ``real'' microservices architecture---discovered that simple changes require modifying multiple services, testing becomes distributed debugging, and Conway's Law isn't just academic theory.

\textbf{The ElasticSearch Regret:} Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch at wer-kennt-wen because ElasticSearch seemed ``too exotic.'' Later watched the platform migrate to ElasticSearch anyway. Lesson: Sometimes the exotic choice becomes the standard.

\textbf{Management Learning Curve:} Accepted Head of Development role without management experience, initially focusing on technical solutions to human problems. Through trial, error, and team patience, evolved toward laissez-faire leadership that actually worked.

\textbf{The Middleware That Shouldn't Exist:} Built production-grade Golang middleware at Saloodo! that was architecturally unnecessary---an integrated AWS Lambda solution would have been simpler, cheaper, and more robust. Sometimes solving the problem beautifully isn't the same as solving the right problem.

\sectionheader{Technical Competencies \& Opinions}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}p{3cm}X@{}}
\textbf{Languages} & Java (18y of Spring Stockholm Syndrome), Golang (4y of rediscovering simplicity), PHP (8y of ``it works don't touch it''), TypeScript (enough to be dangerous) \\[0.2em]
\textbf{Architecture} & Self-contained Systems (SCS) enthusiast after microservices disillusionment, Event-driven architecture, Cloud-native design, Legacy modernization specialist \\[0.2em]
\textbf{Cloud Platforms} & AWS (7y), Azure (4y), GCP (limited but sufficient) - All roads lead to vendor lock-in \\[0.2em]
\textbf{DevOps Philosophy} & Infrastructure-as-Code believer, CI/CD automation evangelist, ``You build it, you run it'' survivor \\[0.2em]
\textbf{Testing Approach} & Comprehensive test pyramids, Contract testing advocate, 10-minute builds despite 1000+ tests (parallelization saves sanity) \\[0.2em]
\textbf{Leadership Style} & Technical mentoring, Cross-functional team building, Stakeholder translation, Constructive technology skepticism

\sectionheader{Recent Professional Adventures}

\jobheader{Cloud Architect at LBBW}{Nov 2024--Present}{Phoenix IT Modernization}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{The Platform That Wasn't:} Arrived to architect migration to ``Skywalker'' platform that exists but isn't production-ready. Currently cataloging hundreds of legacy applications while the target platform evolves---like planning a move while the new house is still being built.
\item \textbf{R-Methodology Reality:} Applying systematic cloud migration assessment using R-methodology (Retire, Retain, Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild) to discover most applications fall into ``it's complicated'' category not covered by AWS documentation.
\item \textbf{Enterprise Banking Complexity:} Learning that ``just migrate it to the cloud'' becomes significantly more interesting when compliance, regulation, and ``we can't break the money system'' enter the conversation.
\item \textbf{Elastisys Evaluation:} Evaluated Elastisys Welkin platform as alternative to Azure---discovering that choosing cloud platforms is like choosing between different flavors of complexity, each with their own delightful surprises.
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{Cloud Architect at Union Investment}{Oct 2021--Dec 2024}{B2B Platform Modernization}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{The Monolith Liberation Project:} Successfully decomposed Liferay-based monolith into Self-contained Systems using microfrontends. Discovered that breaking up monoliths is like renovating while living in the house---messy but ultimately worth it.
\item \textbf{The 60-Person-Day Decision:} Made direct implementation decision for Web Components integration without exhaustive analysis, saving approximately 60 person-days. Sometimes ``bias for action'' beats ``analysis paralysis''---even if it makes architects nervous.
\item \textbf{Algolia vs ElasticSearch:} After comprehensive evaluation, chose Algolia over ElasticSearch for distributed search. Learned that sometimes paying more for managed services is cheaper than heroic self-hosting adventures.
\item \textbf{Event-Driven Search Architecture:} Built unified search across 8 autonomous domains using Azure Event Hubs. Discovered that ``simple'' event streaming becomes delightfully complex when domains have different data models, APIs, and authorization levels.
\item \textbf{360Â° Feedback Highlights:} Consistently rated 9-10/10 for technical competence, with feedback noting ``brings exactly what we need'' and areas for growth including ``consider pace of technical explanations for less technical stakeholders.''
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{Middleware Engineer at Saloodo! (DHL)}{Dec 2021--Nov 2024}{Part-Time Golang Adventure}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{The Middleware That Shouldn't Exist:} Built production-grade Golang middleware for Salesforce sync while recognizing the architecture was unnecessary. An AWS Lambda integration would have been simpler, cheaper, and more robust---but sometimes you build what's asked, not what's optimal.
\item \textbf{Database Schema Adventures:} Handled Saloodo's ``creative'' database with malformed JSON values and incorrect types. Built robust error handling for data that regularly violated its own schema---defensive programming taken to artistic levels.
\item \textbf{Solo Ownership Reality:} As sole developer, owned complete lifecycle from requirements to operations. Achieved 100\% uptime through comprehensive testing and fault-tolerant design, proving that sometimes small teams can outperform large ones.
\item \textbf{Golang Production Baptism:} First professional Golang experience handling \textasciitilde 10 million record synchronizations. Learned that Go's simplicity is a feature, not a limitation---refreshing after years of Java complexity.
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{Cloud Consultant at Trusted Shops}{Aug 2018--Oct 2019}{Microservices Reality Check}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{Microservices Disillusionment:} First encounter with ``real'' microservices architecture. Simple changes required modifications across multiple services, testing became distributed debugging, and maintenance suffered from lack of automation. Became fundamentally skeptical of microservices as overarching architecture.
\item \textbf{AWS Lambda with Java:} Built AWS Lambda functions with Java, creating comprehensive templates with Micronaut for team adoption. Learned that serverless Java requires more creativity than serverless JavaScript---but the templates worked.
\item \textbf{Clean Code Evangelism:} Applied Clean Code principles across 13+ repositories with measurable improvements. Discovered that code quality standards actually accelerate development velocity despite initial resistance from teams.
\item \textbf{Salesforce Integration Adventures:} Implemented seamless Salesforce and Zuora integration for subscription management. Learned that ``seamless integration'' is an oxymoron when dealing with enterprise SaaS platforms.
\end{itemize}

\sectionheader{Earlier Career Lessons \& Character Building}

\jobheader{Senior Engineer at toom Baumarkt}{Oct 2016--Sep 2017}{Kubernetes Skepticism Origin Story}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{First Docker \& Kubernetes Encounter:} Initial experience with docker-compose and Kubernetes. Concluded that Kubernetes is ``too complex for both operations and development teams''---an opinion that has aged surprisingly well despite being unpopular at the time.
\item \textbf{Cross-Team Quality Leadership:} Led quality initiatives across 4 development teams while developing microservices. Learned that quality standards are like vegetables---everyone agrees they're important, but implementation requires persistent gentle pressure.
\item \textbf{Performance Optimization Wins:} Achieved 70\% improvement in end-to-end test execution and significant Java memory optimization through GC tuning. Sometimes the old-school approaches still deliver the biggest wins.
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{Head of Development at wer-kennt-wen}{Oct 2008--Mar 2010}{Management Learning Laboratory}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{The Leadership Experiment:} Accepted management role without sufficient experience, initially treating people problems as technical problems. Through team patience and management training, evolved toward laissez-faire leadership that actually worked for both personality and team needs.
\item \textbf{Sphinx vs ElasticSearch Decision:} Selected Sphinx over ElasticSearch because ES seemed ``too exotic.'' Watched platform later migrate to ElasticSearch anyway---learned that conservative technology choices aren't always safe technology choices.
\item \textbf{9 Million Users Scale:} Successfully scaled social network architecture for 9+ million users during Germany's social media boom. Learned that scaling isn't just about technology---it's about processes, people, and accepting that some problems can't be solved, only managed.
\end{itemize}

\subsectionheader{Additional Professional Adventures}

\textbf{Early Freelancing Projects (2014-2016):} Multiple short-term contracts implementing Jenkins CI/CD for 6+ companies, AWS migrations, and Docker integration. Learned that every company thinks their infrastructure is unique, but most problems have been solved before.

\textbf{Allianz Global Digital Factory (2017-2018):} JavaEE applications on CloudFoundry (AWS-hosted). Discovered that enterprise development involves more meetings about development than actual development.

\textbf{Various Cloud Consulting:} YOOCHOOSE, Xsite, freshcells systems, fotocommunity, billiger-mietwagen.de, AffiliCon, dailypresent. Pattern recognition: Every startup believes they're disrupting everything, but most need the same fundamental infrastructure improvements.

\sectionheader{Personal Projects \& Side Quests}

\textbf{ConversationalAI4J (2025):} Java library for voice-enabled conversational AI using local models. Building complete speech pipeline with Whisper.cpp and Piper TTS because apparently the world needs more ways to argue with computers.

\textbf{SchulteDev Portfolio Repository (2025):} Automated CV generation using Claude 4 API and LaTeX. Meta-project: using AI to write about using AI to write about professional experience. The recursion is intentional.

\textbf{AI Document Processing (2025):} CLI application using Azure Document Intelligence for automated tax document capture. Discovered that teaching computers to read receipts is harder than teaching humans to organize them.

\textbf{Atlassian Bamboo Add-ons (2016-2023):} Commercial marketplace add-ons integrating code quality metrics. 83 customers across 15+ countries, 7-year sustainable business. Learned that solving small problems well beats solving big problems poorly.

\textbf{Crypto-Arbitrage Trading Bot (2015):} Automated Bitcoin arbitrage algorithms with machine learning. Built during crypto's ``mathematical money'' phase before it became ``digital tulips and NFT art.'' The bot worked; market rationality was... intermittent.

\textbf{Jenkins \textrightarrow{} GitHub Integration PoC (2018):} Automatic Jenkins setup for GitHub repositories. Proof of concept for ``infrastructure should be invisible''---though like most PoCs, it proved the concept was more complex than initially obvious.
