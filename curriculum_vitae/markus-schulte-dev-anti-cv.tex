% Professional Anti-Summary
\section{Professional Anti-Summary}

\textbf{What I've Actually Learned:} 18+ years of making every mistake in the book so you don't have to. Currently serving as Cloud Architect at LBBW, where I'm probably overcomplicating things again but at least I know it now.

\textbf{My Greatest Hits of Failure:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Accepted Head of Development role at 24 without management experience (spoiler: technical skills $\neq$ leadership skills)
\item Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch because ``that ElasticSearch thing looks too fancy'' (it wasn't)
\item Fell for the microservices hype, then spent 2 years debugging inter-service communication
\item Thought Kubernetes was the answer to everything until I tried explaining it to an ops team
\item Took 9 years to finish a 5-year degree because I was too busy ``learning in the real world''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What I'm Good At Now:} Making the same mistakes faster and with better documentation.

% Key Disasters That Shaped Me
\section{Key Disasters That Shaped Me}

\subsection{The ``I Can Manage People'' Delusion (2008-2010)}
\textbf{Company:} wer-kennt-wen.de (9M+ users, no pressure)\\
\textbf{Role:} Head of Development\\
\textbf{The Disaster:} Thought being good at code meant I'd be good at managing humans. Turns out people are way more complex than databases and significantly less predictable than unit tests.

\textbf{What I Learned:} 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Technical competence $\neq$ management competence (shocking, I know)
\item ``Just fix it'' is not effective feedback for junior developers
\item Laissez-faire leadership works better when you actually know what laissez-faire means
\item UML diagrams don't solve people problems
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Silver Lining:} Eventually became decent at leading technical teams, just took a decade of therapy and self-reflection.

\subsection{The ``Conservative Technology Choice'' Masterclass (2011)}
\textbf{Context:} Choosing search engine for 9M user platform\\
\textbf{The Disaster:} Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch because ``ElasticSearch looks too new and fancy.'' Classic ``nobody got fired for buying IBM'' mentality.

\textbf{What I Learned:} 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Sometimes the ``fancy new thing'' is actually just better
\item ``Boring technology'' doesn't mean ``deliberately outdated technology''
\item Migration costs are real, but so are opportunity costs
\item My spider-sense for good tech was clearly malfunctioning
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Irony:} Platform migrated to ElasticSearch after I returned as Backend Developer. Turns out I was right to be wrong about being right.

\subsection{The Microservices Honeymoon Period (2018-2019)}
\textbf{Company:} Trusted Shops\\
\textbf{The Disaster:} Finally encountered ``real'' microservices architecture. Spent months debugging inter-service communication before realizing simple changes required touching 47 different repositories.

\textbf{What I Learned:} 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Microservices solve organizational problems, not technical ones
\item Distributed systems are hard, distributed debugging is harder
\item Conway's Law is not just a clever saying, it's a warning
\item Sometimes a well-structured monolith is perfectly fine
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Character Development:} Became evangelist for Self-contained Systems (SCS) - like microservices but with actual boundaries that make sense.

% Recent Professional Disasters
\section{Recent Professional Learning Experiences}

\subsection{November 2024 -- Present: Cloud Architect at LBBW}
\textbf{Current Mission:} ``Phoenix'' IT Modernization for major German state bank\\
\textbf{Team:} 9 people in my team, 80+ people total (yes, really)\\
\textbf{The Challenge:} Migrating hundreds of legacy applications to Azure ``Skywalker'' platform that's never been used in production.

\textbf{What I'm Learning Now:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Banking regulations make everything 10x more complicated
\item ``Production-unused'' platforms are exactly as fun as they sound
\item Enterprise architecture is 20\% technical design, 80\% stakeholder management
\item The R-methodology for cloud migration is actually pretty good (who knew?)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technologies I'm Pretending to Master:} Azure (all of it), Kubernetes (again), Enterprise Decision Making

\subsection{October 2021 -- December 2024: Cloud Architect at Union Investment}
\textbf{The Mission:} Modernize B2B sales platform serving 80,000 users\\
\textbf{The Plot Twist:} Spent 3 years building Self-contained Systems architecture that actually works

\textbf{What Went Surprisingly Right:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Built microfrontend toolkit that teams actually wanted to use
\item Achieved 99.9\% uptime (mostly by accident)
\item Reduced deployment time from days to 30 minutes
\item Created architecture template adopted group-wide
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What I Finally Learned:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Event-driven architecture is great when events actually drive something
\item Web Components are criminally underrated
\item Azure Static Web Apps are surprisingly non-terrible
\item 1000+ tests can run in 10 minutes if you parallelize aggressively
\end{itemize}

\textbf{360° Feedback Highlights:} ``Brings exactly what we need'' and ``Consider pace of technical explanations'' (translation: talks too fast about technical stuff)

\subsection{December 2021 -- November 2024: Middleware Engineer at Saloodo! (DHL)}
\textbf{Part-Time Side Quest:} Sync 10M records between Saloodo and Salesforce\\
\textbf{The Reality:} Sole developer responsible for business-critical data synchronization

\textbf{What I Learned About Being Alone:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Golang is actually pretty nice for this kind of work
\item Being the only developer is terrifying and liberating
\item 100\% uptime is possible with enough paranoia
\item Saloodo's database schema was clearly designed by committee
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technologies:} Golang, PostgreSQL, Salesforce APIs, Existential Dread

\subsection{The Kubernetes Enlightenment (2016-2017)}
\textbf{Company:} toom Baumarkt\\
\textbf{The Hype:} ``Kubernetes will solve all our problems!''\\
\textbf{The Reality:} Spent more time configuring Kubernetes than actually solving business problems

\textbf{What I Learned:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=0.1em]
\item Kubernetes is a tool for IT operations solution providers
\item Simple applications deserve simple deployment strategies
\item YAML is not a programming language, no matter how much you write
\item ``Cloud native'' doesn't mean ``unnecessarily complex''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Current Status:} Kubernetes skeptic who uses managed services whenever possible.
