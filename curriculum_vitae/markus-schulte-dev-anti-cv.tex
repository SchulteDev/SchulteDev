\section*{Professional Summary}

After 18+ years of making spectacular mistakes in software development, I've finally learned enough from my failures to occasionally build things that work. Currently serving as Cloud Architect at LBBW, where I'm discovering just how many ways enterprise banking systems can resist modernization.

\textbf{Core Incompetencies:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{Over-Engineering:} Consistently building solutions that are 3x more complex than needed
\item \textbf{Technology Addiction:} Cannot resist trying new frameworks, resulting in diverse but fragmented expertise
\item \textbf{Perfectionism:} Spending weeks optimizing build times from 11 to 10 minutes while missing actual deadlines
\item \textbf{Communication Gaps:} Explaining technical concepts so thoroughly that stakeholders forget what they originally asked
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Most Spectacular "Achievements":}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item Built microfrontend architecture so complex it required dedicated documentation team
\item Created middleware that handled 10M records but crashed on malformed JSON (rookie mistake \#47)
\item Spent 6 months building search system only to discover Algolia could do it in 2 weeks
\item Led teams that consistently delivered high-quality software... 3 months late
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Lessons Learned from Professional Disasters}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|X|X}
\textbf{Mistake Category} & \textbf{Frequency} & \textbf{Recovery Time} \\
\hline
Over-architecting simple problems & Weekly & 2-3 sprints \\
Choosing bleeding-edge tech & Monthly & 6-12 months \\
Assuming clean data exists & Always & Eternal suffering \\
Estimating "just a small change" & Daily & 2x original estimate \\
\end{tabularx}

\section*{Recent Professional Disasters}

\subsection*{November 2024 — Present: Cloud Architect at LBBW (Learning Banking is Hard)}

\textbf{Project:} "Phoenix" IT Modernization — Attempting to modernize Germany's banking infrastructure

\textbf{Key Failures \& Lessons:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{Cataloging Catastrophe:} Discovered that "hundreds of legacy applications" actually means "nobody knows what we have." Currently building spreadsheets to track spreadsheets that track other systems.
\item \textbf{Azure Learning Curve:} Confidently evaluated Elastisys Welkin only to realize banking regulations make every cloud decision a 6-month committee process.
\item \textbf{Migration Reality Check:} R-methodology (6 R's of cloud migration) quickly became "7th R: Regret" when discovering that legacy COBOL systems have personal relationships with specific server hardware.
\item \textbf{Platform Gap Analysis:} Found so many gaps in the unused Skywalker platform that I spent more time documenting problems than solving them. Created beautiful architecture diagrams that perfectly document what doesn't work.
\item \textbf{Cost Calculation Comedy:} Azure Calculator estimates looked reasonable until someone mentioned "banking compliance multiplier" — suddenly every service costs 10x more.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technologies That Humbled Me:} Azure (steeper than expected), Banking Regulations (steeper than Everest), Enterprise Politics (steeper than reality)

\subsection*{October 2021 — December 2024: "Master" Architect at Union Investment}

\textbf{Project:} IT Landscape Modernization — Building templates for corporate-wide transformation

\textbf{Epic Failures \& Hard-Won Wisdom:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{Microfrontend Mania:} Convinced team that Web Components were the future. Built custom toolkit so complex it required dedicated onboarding workshops. Junior developers needed 3 weeks to add a button.
\item \textbf{Event-Driven Overengineering:} Designed event streaming architecture for unified search. What should have been simple API calls became 8-domain event choreography with Azure Event Hubs. Search worked perfectly... after 18 months of development.
\item \textbf{Team Building Troubles:} Built development team "from ground up" — turns out recruiting developers during 2022 tech boom was like shopping for unicorns with monopoly money.
\item \textbf{Testing Obsession:} Achieved 1000+ tests with 10-minute build time. Spent 6 months optimizing test parallelization that saved 90 seconds. Could have used those months to actually build features.
\item \textbf{Technology ADHD:} Jumped from Liferay to Spring Boot to Azure Functions to Web Components to Algolia. Final architecture looked like a technology conference exploded.
\item \textbf{Deployment Speed Delusion:} Proudly reduced deployment time from "several days to 30 minutes." Forgot to mention that preparing deployment now takes 2 days of testing, approvals, and coordination.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{360° Feedback Reality Check:} Team consistently rated my technical skills 9-10/10 while diplomatically suggesting I "consider pace of explanations for less technical stakeholders." Translation: "Stop overwhelming people with architecture diagrams."

\subsection*{December 2021 — November 2024: Solo Middleware Developer at Saloodo! (DHL)}

\textbf{Project:} Salesforce Integration — Synchronizing 10M records without breaking everything

\textbf{Humbling Discoveries:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{Database Optimism:} Assumed production database would have consistent data types. Discovered JSON fields containing XML, timestamps as strings, and foreign keys pointing to deleted records. Built error handling more robust than the original application.
\item \textbf{Solo Developer Syndrome:} Took part-time project to "learn Golang professionally." Ended up being sole developer for business-critical system. Learned that 100\% production uptime comes with 24/7 anxiety.
\item \textbf{Multi-threading Misadventures:} Proudly implemented multi-threading for 10M record sync. Discovered that PostgreSQL connection pooling + Golang goroutines + malformed data = spectacular crashes at 3 AM.
\item \textbf{Scale Shock:} "Periodic full synchronization" sounded manageable until realizing it meant processing truck locations, driver data, delivery status, and customer information for entire European logistics network.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technologies That Taught Me Humility:} Golang (memory management), PostgreSQL (connection limits), Salesforce API (rate limiting), Production Systems (Murphy's Law)

\section*{Earlier Professional Learning Experiences}

\subsection*{August 2018 — October 2019: Cloud Consultant at Trusted Shops}

\textbf{AWS Awakening:} Confidently migrated JavaEE6 monolith to cloud-native microservices. Created 13+ repositories, each with unique deployment pipeline. Achieved microservices architecture so distributed that finding which service handled password resets required detective work.

\textbf{Contract Testing Evangelism:} Introduced Pact framework with religious fervor. Spent more time maintaining test contracts than actual business logic. Team eventually automated contract testing so thoroughly that they forgot how the actual APIs worked.

\subsection*{October 2016 — September 2017: Senior Engineer at toom Baumarkt}

\textbf{Quality Leadership Delusions:} Led "weekly cross-team quality initiatives" — essentially created more meetings about code quality than time spent writing code. Reduced end-to-end test execution by 70\% through optimization, then spent equivalent time in quality meetings.

\textbf{Memory Optimization Obsession:} Achieved Java microservice memory optimization through extensive Garbage Collection tuning. Celebrated reducing memory usage while ignoring that AWS instances had 16GB RAM and services used 500MB.

\subsection*{June 2016 — December 2023: Atlassian Marketplace Entrepreneur}

\textbf{Product Business Reality:} Built Bamboo Server add-ons for code quality integration. Achieved sustainable 7-year business with global customers, then watched Atlassian discontinue Server products. Perfect timing.

\textbf{Niche Market Mastery:} Became expert in dying technology (Bamboo Server) while industry moved to GitHub Actions. Maintained 83 customers across 15 countries using increasingly obsolete platform.

\subsection*{August 2007 — June 2014: Head of Development at werkenntwen}

\textbf{Social Network Scaling:} Led development for 9M+ user platform during Facebook's rise. Spent years optimizing MySQL partitioning and Memcache deployment while users migrated to Facebook. Platform eventually shut down in 2014.

\textbf{Architecture Modernization:} Transformed procedural PHP to object-oriented Zend Framework architecture. Built beautiful MVC patterns for platform that was already becoming obsolete. Perfect technical execution of irrelevant solution.

\section*{Personal Projects (Experiments in Over-Engineering)}

\subsection*{2025: SchulteDev Portfolio Repository}
Built AI-powered CV generation using Claude 4 API. Created sophisticated GitHub Actions pipeline to automate professional portfolio management. Spent more time building the automation than time saved by automation.

\subsection*{2025: AI Document Processing for Tax Software}
Developed CLI application using Azure Document Intelligence for tax document automation. Built solution more complex than manual process it replaced. Classic over-engineering victory.

\subsection*{2018: Jenkins ↔ GitHub Integration PoC}
Created multi-tenant Jenkins setup with automatic GitHub integration. Built comprehensive proof-of-concept during peak Docker hype. Project completed just as industry moved to GitHub Actions.

\subsection*{2015: Crypto-Arbitrage Trading Bot}
Implemented machine learning algorithms for Bitcoin arbitrage trading. Built sophisticated trading system during early crypto days. Achieved perfect technical implementation that barely broke even after hosting costs.

\section*{Education \& Certifications}

\textbf{2004 — 2012: Diploma in Computer Science, University of Koblenz-Landau}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item Degree took 8 years instead of standard 5 years — worked full-time while studying, proving early mastery of overcommitment
\item Graduated with distinction while working as Head of Development, demonstrating ability to excel at everything except time management
\item Specialized in Computational Visualistics — perfect preparation for career in backend development
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical Certifications:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item \textbf{Java SE 8 TechCheck:} 93/100 score, 88th percentile — peaked just as industry moved to newer versions
\item \textbf{StackOverflow:} 4000+ reputation points — proof of ability to answer questions instead of building software
\end{itemize}

\section*{Career Philosophy \& Lessons Learned}

After 18 years of professional mistakes, I've learned that:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,itemsep=0.2em]
\item The best architecture is the one that actually gets delivered
\item "Just a small change" is always a trap
\item Perfect code that's delivered late is worse than good code delivered on time
\item Every database contains surprises, usually unpleasant ones
\item If you're the smartest person in the room, you're probably in the wrong room
\item Documentation is like insurance — you need it most when you least want to create it
\end{itemize}

\section*{Career Breaks (Recovery Time)}

\textbf{April 2020 — September 2021:} Parental Leave during COVID-19 — Perfect timing to step away from technology industry during its most rapid transformation period.

\textbf{August 2015 — December 2015:} Personal Travel Break — Explored different countries and cultures, returned with fresh perspective and completely outdated technical skills.

\textbf{August 2003 — March 2004:} Mandatory Military Service — German air force, learned discipline and attention to detail that I immediately forgot upon returning to software development.
