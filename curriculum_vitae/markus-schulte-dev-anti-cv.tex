\section*{Professional Summary: 18 Years of ``Character Building''}

\textbf{Cloud Architect \& Software Engineer} who has spent 18+ years learning why things don't work before figuring out how they should. Currently helping LBBW's ``Phoenix'' rise from the ashes of legacy systems, having previously survived the trenches of enterprise modernization at Union Investment.

\textbf{My Journey of Educational Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item \textbf{Management Hubris:} Accepted Head of Development role at age 25 without management experience. Learned that technical skills don't magically translate to people skills. Evolved from ``dictator'' to ``laissez-faire'' leadership through trial and error.
    \item \textbf{Technology FOMO:} Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch in 2010 because ES seemed ``too exotic.'' Platform later migrated to ElasticSearch anyway. Lesson: Sometimes the shiny new thing is actually better.
    \item \textbf{Microservices Reality Check:} First encounter with ``real'' microservices at Trusted Shops revealed the lived disadvantages nobody talks about. Simple changes required touching 5+ services. Now prefer Self-contained Systems after learning the hard way.
    \item \textbf{Kubernetes Skepticism:} Discovered Kubernetes at toom Baumarkt. Concluded it's too complex for mere mortals. Still believe it's a tool for ``IT operations solution providers,'' not regular humans trying to deploy apps.
    \item \textbf{Solo Developer Syndrome:} Spent 3 years as the only developer maintaining Saloodo's middleware. Achieved 100\% uptime through paranoia and excessive testing. Learned that being irreplaceable is both a blessing and a curse.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Accidental Wins That Somehow Worked:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item \textbf{Bias for Action:} Saved 60 person-days at Union Investment by implementing Web Components without exploring alternatives. Sometimes decisive action beats analysis paralysis.
    \item \textbf{Quality Obsession:} Implemented comprehensive testing everywhere, even when colleagues thought it was overkill. Turns out 1000+ tests and 10-minute build cycles are possible and profitable.
    \item \textbf{Technology Pragmatism:} Chose Algolia over ElasticSearch after thorough analysis. Sometimes the ``easy'' solution is the right solution.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Core ``Expertise'' \& Hard-Won Lessons}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{4cm}X}
\textbf{Languages} & Java (18y of Stockholm syndrome), Golang (4y of enlightenment), PHP (8y of ``how did this work?''), TypeScript (as needed for survival) \\
\textbf{Cloud Platforms} & AWS (7y of ``it's always DNS''), Azure (4y of ``why is everything called 'App'?''), GCP (occasional flirtation) \\
\textbf{Architecture} & Microservices (skeptical), Self-contained Systems (convert), Event-driven (when it works), Monoliths (honest about trade-offs) \\
\textbf{DevOps} & Docker (useful), Kubernetes (too complex), Terraform (love-hate relationship), CI/CD (essential for sanity) \\
\textbf{Leadership} & Team building (learned through mistakes), Stakeholder management (ongoing education), Product Owner (interim survival) \\
\textbf{Testing} & Unit testing (religious), Integration testing (practical), Contract testing (Pact evangelist), E2E testing (necessary evil) \\
\textbf{Databases} & PostgreSQL (reliable friend), MySQL (old companion), Oracle (expensive acquaintance), MS-SQL (when required) \\
\end{tabularx}

\section*{Business Impact: When Things Actually Worked}

\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item \textbf{Platform Scale:} Delivered systems serving 9M+ users (wer-kennt-wen.de) - before learning that scale brings unique problems
    \item \textbf{Deployment Speed:} Reduced deployment time from days to 30 minutes - after experiencing the pain of manual deployments
    \item \textbf{System Reliability:} Achieved 99.9\% uptime through paranoid testing and monitoring - learned from production failures
    \item \textbf{Team Productivity:} Enabled 10x faster deployment cycles through automation - after manually deploying for years
    \item \textbf{Architecture Templates:} Created reusable patterns adopted across enterprise - after seeing too many reinvented wheels
\end{itemize}

\textbf{My Slogan:} ``Crafting solutions that thrive today and tomorrow'' (after making enough mistakes to know what doesn't work)

\section*{Philosophy: What I've Learned}

\textbf{On Technology:} Every technology is a tool with trade-offs. Popularity doesn't equal suitability. Sometimes the boring solution is the right solution.

\textbf{On Architecture:} Simple systems are easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Complexity should be justified by actual requirements, not theoretical possibilities.

\textbf{On Teams:} Good people are more important than perfect processes. Clear communication prevents more problems than sophisticated tools.

\textbf{On Quality:} Comprehensive testing and automation pay for themselves quickly. Technical debt is like financial debt --- it compounds over time.

\textbf{On Leadership:} Management is a skill that must be learned, not an automatic promotion. Leading by example is more effective than leading by authority.

\vspace{0.5em}

\section*{Current Interests \& Future Learning}

\textbf{AI Integration:} Exploring practical applications of AI in software development and business processes\\
\textbf{Platform Engineering:} Understanding how to build developer platforms that teams actually want to use\\
\textbf{Sustainability:} Investigating how software architecture decisions impact environmental footprint\\
\textbf{Distributed Systems:} Continuing to learn about eventual consistency and distributed system trade-offs
