\section*{Professional Summary: 18 Years of Learning Things the Hard Way}

\textbf{Cloud Architect \& Professional Complexity Enthusiast} who spent 18+ years discovering why simple solutions are called ``best practices'' for a reason. Currently helping LBBW navigate the treacherous waters of enterprise cloud migration, where I catalog hundreds of legacy applications that somehow still run despite defying all known laws of software engineering.

\textbf{Core Expertise in Making Things Harder Than Necessary:}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{Enterprise Architecture:} Converting perfectly functional monoliths into distributed nightmares since 2018
\item \textbf{Technical Leadership:} Successfully managed teams after learning that ``just code better'' isn't actually management advice
\item \textbf{Cloud-Native Design:} Expert at creating microservices that require 47 configuration files to say ``Hello World''
\item \textbf{DevOps Excellence:} Achieved 10-minute builds with only 1000+ tests (yes, that's a feature, not a bug)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Career Achievements \& Reality Checks}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|X}
\textbf{What I Thought I Was Doing} & \textbf{What Actually Happened} \\
\hline
Building scalable microservices at Trusted Shops & Created systems where changing a button required updating 6 repositories \\
Leading development team at werkenntwen (2008) & Discovered that being good at PHP doesn't qualify you to manage humans \\
Choosing Sphinx over ElasticSearch & Picked the technology that became obsolete while ES became industry standard \\
Implementing Kubernetes at toom Baumarkt & Introduced complexity that neither ops nor devs could fully understand \\
Creating ``elegant'' event-driven architectures & Built Rube Goldberg machines that occasionally delivered messages \\
Saving 60 person-days with quick decisions & Also probably cost 60 person-days with other ``quick'' decisions \\
\end{tabularx}

\section*{Technical Skills: A Journey Through the Hype Cycle}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|X}
\textbf{Languages} & Java (18y of verbosity), Golang (4y of ``look ma, no generics!''), PHP (8y of regret), TypeScript (when forced) \\
\textbf{Clouds} & AWS (where I learned S3 isn't infinite), Azure (where everything needs 5 names), GCP (briefly) \\
\textbf{Containers} & Docker (makes it work on your machine AND production), Kubernetes (job security through complexity) \\
\textbf{Databases} & PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle (expensive), MS-SQL (also expensive), Redis (when nothing else is fast enough) \\
\textbf{Methodologies} & Agile (aka ``we'll figure it out in sprint 47''), SAFe (Agile with more meetings), Waterfall (nostalgically) \\
\textbf{Testing} & Writing more test code than actual code and calling it ``quality assurance'' \\
\end{tabularx}

\section*{Professional Experience: Learning From Mistakes Since 2007}

\subsection*{Nov 2024 -- Present: Cloud Architect at LBBW}
\textit{Helping a German state bank discover why ``Phoenix'' is an ironic name for an IT project}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cataloging hundreds of legacy applications using the ``R-methodology'' (aka ``Retire, Rehost, or Regret'')
\item Evaluating the ``Skywalker'' platform that's been in development since 2023 but unused in production (red flag \#1)
\item Writing Azure architecture documents that will definitely be followed exactly as specified (narrator: they won't)
\item Discovering that banking IT moves at the speed of regulatory compliance, not innovation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Oct 2021 -- Dec 2024: Cloud Architect at Union Investment}
\textit{3+ years building tomorrow's legacy system today}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decomposed a monolith into 8 Self-contained Systems because microservices weren't complicated enough
\item Implemented Web Components when everyone else was using React (being different isn't always better)
\item Created a microfrontend toolkit that required extensive documentation to explain why it was ``simple''
\item Achieved 99.9\% uptime, meaning we had 8.76 hours of downtime to contemplate our architecture choices
\item Built event-driven architecture where events sometimes arrived, sometimes didn't, always surprised us
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dec 2021 -- Nov 2024: Middleware Engineer at Saloodo! (Part-time)}
\textit{Because one complex project wasn't enough stress}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sole developer for ``critical'' middleware that probably could have been an AWS Lambda
\item Synchronized 10 million records periodically because real-time sync was ``too expensive''
\item Wrote 2,776 lines of Golang to work around Saloodo's database inconsistencies instead of fixing the source
\item Achieved 100\% uptime by making the system so fault-tolerant it basically couldn't fail (or do much)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Aug 2018 -- Oct 2019: Cloud Consultant at Trusted Shops}
\textit{My first real encounter with microservices hell}
\begin{itemize}
\item Witnessed firsthand why ``microservices'' often means ``distributed monolith with extra steps''
\item Taught contract testing to teams who then promptly ignored it when deadlines approached
\item Migrated from JavaEE6 (old but working) to microservices (new but requiring 10x maintenance)
\item Learned that Pact testing is great until you have 50 services and 2500 contract combinations
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Oct 2016 -- Sep 2017: Senior Engineer at toom Baumarkt}
\textit{Where I learned Kubernetes is German for ``job security''}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced Kubernetes, which was too complex for both ops and dev teams (but looked great on my CV)
\item Optimized e2e tests by 70\% -- from ``incredibly slow'' to just ``very slow''
\item Part of team ``Butterkekse'' (butter cookies) -- even our team name suggested we'd crumble under pressure
\item Implemented ``you build it, you run it'' which really meant ``you build it, you debug it at 3 AM''
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section*{Previous Adventures in Overengineering}

\subsection*{Aug 2007 -- Jun 2014: From Developer to Head of Development at werkenntwen}
\textit{Germany's Facebook competitor that lost to... Facebook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Became Head of Development at age 24 with zero management experience (what could go wrong?)
\item Managed 9 million users on a platform built with PHP and hope
\item Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch, a decision that aged like milk in the sun
\item Learned that ``laissez-faire leadership'' is French for ``I don't know what I'm doing either''
\item Company shut down in 2014 -- correlation or causation? We'll never know
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2016 -- 2023: Atlassian Bamboo Add-on Business}
\textit{7 years selling CI/CD plugins to people who could have used Jenkins for free}
\begin{itemize}
\item Created add-ons for code quality metrics because developers love being told their code is bad
\item 83 customers globally who apparently enjoyed paying for complexity
\item Maintained compatibility with Bamboo's API changes (aka full-time job)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Freelance Years (2014-2016): Learning What Not to Do}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiple companies:} Introduced Jenkins CI to teams who then discovered why ``continuous'' means ``constantly breaking''
\item \textbf{fotocommunity:} Implemented Docker when Docker was still figuring out what Docker was
\item \textbf{YOOCHOOSE:} AWS operations, where I learned that ``cloud'' doesn't mean ``cheap''
\item \textbf{freshcells:} Established PHP quality standards (oxymoron detected)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Personal Projects: Overengineering in My Spare Time}

\subsection*{2025: ConversationalAI4J}
Built a Java library for voice-enabled AI conversations because apparently typing is too mainstream. Features a ``complete'' speech pipeline that's only mostly complete.

\subsection*{2025: AI-Powered CV Generation}
Created an automated CV generation system using Claude 4 because manually updating a CV is beneath someone who automates everything else. This Anti-CV was, ironically, generated by it.

\subsection*{2018: Jenkins-GitHub Integration PoC}
Built a multi-tenant Jenkins setup that nobody asked for, solving a problem that GitHub Actions would solve better a year later.

\subsection*{2015: Crypto Arbitrage Trading Bot}
Created a Bitcoin trading bot just in time for the 2015 crypto winter. The machine learning model learned mainly how to lose money efficiently.

\section*{Academic \& Military Excellence}

\subsection*{2004 -- 2012: Diplom in Computer Science, University of Koblenz}
\begin{itemize}
\item Took 8 years to complete a 5-year program because I was ``gaining real-world experience'' (working to pay rent)
\item Graduated magna cum laude, proving that taking longer doesn't mean doing worse
\item Studied ``Computational Visualistics'' -- a fancy way to say ``computer graphics I never used professionally''
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section*{Additional Skills \& Humbling Experiences}

\subsection*{Certifications That Seemed Important at the Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Java SE 8 TechCheck:} Scored 93/100 in 2018, just before everyone moved to Java 11+
\item \textbf{StackOverflow:} 4000+ reputation points from answering questions I googled 5 minutes earlier
\item \textbf{GitHub Contributor:} Maintaining open source projects with dozens of stars (dozens!)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Career Breaks: Strategic Retreats from Technology}

\textbf{Apr 2020 -- Sep 2021: Parental Leave / COVID Sabbatical}\\
Spent 18 months discovering that managing a toddler is harder than managing microservices. At least microservices don't throw food at you when they crash. Used COVID as a convenient excuse for a career break that was really about questioning life choices after years of distributed systems.

\textbf{Aug 2015 -- Dec 2015: Travel Break}\\
Four months exploring the world and discovering that not everything needs to be containerized, automated, or scaled horizontally. Some things, like sunsets and good wine, work fine as monoliths.

\textbf{Aug 2003 -- Mar 2004: Military Service}\\
Mandatory service in the German Air Force where I learned that ``deployment'' means something very different outside of IT. Discovered that military systems run on procedures older than COBOL and somehow still work.

\subsection*{Philosophical Insights After 18 Years}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{On Microservices:} ``The road to hell is paved with good architectural intentions and HTTP calls''
\item \textbf{On Kubernetes:} ``We've successfully replaced 'works on my machine' with 'works in my cluster'\,''
\item \textbf{On Testing:} ``100\% code coverage means you've tested that your code runs, not that it works''
\item \textbf{On Cloud Migration:} ``Lifting and shifting problems to the cloud just makes them more expensive''
\item \textbf{On Technical Debt:} ``Today's best practice is tomorrow's technical debt''
\item \textbf{On Agile:} ``We've replaced comprehensive documentation with comprehensive confusion''
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What I've Actually Learned}

Despite the self-deprecation, I've learned that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple solutions usually beat clever ones (but clever ones are more fun to build)
\item The best architecture is the one your team can actually maintain at 3 AM
\item Sometimes a monolith is exactly what you need (heresy in 2025, wisdom in 2030)
\item Writing tests is like flossing -- everyone knows they should do more of it
\item The hardest part of software engineering isn't the software or the engineering
\end{itemize}

While the self-deprecating humor and technical cynicism are artificially enhanced for entertainment, all career facts, positions, and experiences are completely accurate. The AI helped transform my genuine experiences into this format, but couldn't make my career choices any less questionable. Any resemblance to your own overengineered solutions is purely coincidental and probably means we should grab a beer and commiserate.}
