\section{Career Disasters Summary}

\textbf{18+ years of spectacular failures} in software development, featuring an impressive collection of overengineered solutions, premature optimizations, and architectural decisions that aged like milk. Currently contributing to Germany's banking sector modernization while learning that "legacy systems" exist for good reasons.

\textbf{Core Incompetencies:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item \textbf{Overthinking Simple Problems:} Consistently transformed 2-week tasks into 6-month architectural epics
    \item \textbf{Technology Addiction:} Compulsive early adopter of bleeding-edge frameworks (usually bleeding for good reasons)
    \item \textbf{Microservices Evangelism:} Learned the hard way that distributed systems create distributed problems
    \item \textbf{Perfectionism Paralysis:} Spent more time optimizing build pipelines than writing actual business logic
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recent Achievements in Failure:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Built a search system so sophisticated it required a PhD to understand (nobody had one)
    \item Created 47 microservices when 3 would have sufficed (with 44 different deployment strategies)
    \item Introduced Web Components in 2022 thinking they were "the future" (they're still the future)
    \item Convinced enterprise clients that Golang was "simple" (narrator: it wasn't)
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Expertise (Things I've Broken)}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\textbf{Languages I've Overengineered With:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Java (18y of verbose solutions)
    \item Golang (4y of premature concurrency)
    \item TypeScript (because JavaScript wasn't complex enough)
    \item PHP (8y of "it works on my machine")
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Architectures I've Overcomplicated:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Microservices (distributed monoliths)
    \item Event-driven (event-driven chaos)
    \item Serverless (server-more)
    \item Cloud-native (cloud-expensive)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tools I've Misused:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Kubernetes (the hammer for all nails)
    \item Docker (containerized confusion)
    \item Terraform (infrastructure as chaos)
    \item Jenkins (continuous frustration)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Platforms I've Overengineered On:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item AWS (Amazingly Wasted Spending)
    \item Azure (A-maze-ing complexity)
    \item GCP (Generally Confusing Platform)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section{Recent Professional Disasters}

\subsection{November 2024 — Present: Cloud Architect at LBBW}
\textbf{Current Catastrophe:} Phoenix IT Modernization

\textbf{Key Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Joined a banking modernization project expecting "modern" - discovered systems older than my career
    \item Evaluated Elastisys Welkin thinking it would simplify things (it added three new complexity layers)
    \item Attempted to catalog "hundreds" of legacy applications - gave up counting after finding COBOL running in production
    \item Created assessment templates so comprehensive they required templates to understand the templates
    \item Convinced stakeholders that Azure migration would be "straightforward" (narrator: it wasn't)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Banking regulations exist to prevent innovation. "Legacy" is not a bug, it's a feature. Excel is actually a legitimate enterprise architecture tool.

\subsection{October 2021 — December 2024: Cloud Architect at Union Investment}
\textbf{The Great Microfrontend Experiment}

\textbf{Epic Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Convinced stakeholders that Web Components were "mature technology" in 2022 (they're still not)
    \item Built a microfrontend framework so sophisticated it required a 3-month onboarding process
    \item Created 8 Self-contained Systems for what could have been 2 well-designed modules
    \item Implemented event-driven architecture with 47 different event types (humans can remember about 7)
    \item Spent 6 months optimizing build times from 30 minutes to 10 minutes instead of questioning why builds took 30 minutes
    \item Introduced Algolia search because "it's simpler than ElasticSearch" (forgot to mention the monthly bills)
    \item Built a search system that required data from 8 different services to display one result
\end{itemize}

\textbf{360° Feedback Reality Check:} Team consistently rated my technical competence 9-10/10 while politely suggesting I explain things in "human language" occasionally.

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Just because you can distribute a system doesn't mean you should. Microservices are not a solution to organizational problems. The second system effect is real and expensive.

\subsection{December 2021 — November 2024: Middleware Engineer at Saloodo!}
\textbf{The Solo Developer Syndrome}

\textbf{Key Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Accepted a "simple data sync" project that involved 10 million records with malformed JSON
    \item Built a fault-tolerant system so robust it kept running even when it shouldn't have
    \item Achieved 100\% uptime through luck, not skill (postgres database was the real hero)
    \item Worked part-time while architecting full-time complexity at Union Investment (multitasking is a myth)
    \item Wrote 2,776 lines of Golang thinking it was "simple" (forgot to mention the 47 error handling patterns)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Being the sole developer means you're the only one to blame. Golang's simplicity is marketing, not reality. Error handling is 80\% of the code.

\subsection{June 2018 — March 2020: Cloud Consultant at Trusted Shops}
\textbf{The Microservices Awakening}

\textbf{Architectural Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Encountered my first "real" microservices architecture - discovered it was a distributed monolith
    \item Simple feature changes required modifications across 13 repositories (counted them)
    \item Introduced contract testing with Pact thinking it would solve integration issues (it created testing issues)
    \item Migrated from JavaEE6 to "modern" Spring Boot (from one framework hell to another)
    \item Built AWS Lambda functions that cost more than the servers they replaced
    \item Implemented Clean Code principles so strictly that code became unreadable
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Career-Defining Moment:} Realized microservices create more problems than they solve. Became permanently skeptical of distributed systems. Started preferring Self-contained Systems (monoliths in disguise).

\section{Earlier Career Disasters}

\subsection{October 2016 — September 2017: Senior Engineer at toom Baumarkt}
\textbf{The Kubernetes Revelation}

\textbf{Key Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item First encounter with Kubernetes - immediately knew it was overengineered for simple applications
    \item Became fundamentally skeptical of K8s (still am) - it's a tool for platform providers, not application developers
    \item Improved test performance by 70\% by discovering tests were doing unnecessary work (should have been obvious)
    \item Led "quality initiatives" across 4 teams while secretly questioning if quality was the real problem
    \item Optimized Java garbage collection instead of questioning why the application used so much memory
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Kubernetes is a solution looking for a problem. Most applications don't need distributed orchestration. Docker-compose is often sufficient.

\subsection{January 2014 — August 2016: Early Freelancing Adventures}
\textbf{The CI/CD Evangelism Phase}

\textbf{Notable Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Convinced 6+ companies they needed Jenkins when most just needed "git push"
    \item Built Docker environments for PHP testing when local testing worked fine
    \item Implemented "pipeline-as-code" for 3-person teams (over-engineering at its finest)
    \item Reduced infrastructure costs by 40\% by eliminating solutions I had previously recommended
    \item Created "comprehensive" CI/CD pipelines that took longer to maintain than the applications they built
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Not every team needs enterprise-grade CI/CD. Sometimes wget and rsync are sufficient. Jenkins is not a productivity multiplier for small teams.

\subsection{August 2007 — June 2014: PHP Developer at wer-kennt-wen}
\textbf{The Leadership Experiment}

\textbf{Management Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Became Head of Development at age 24 without management experience (company and I both learned the hard way)
    \item Assumed technical competence would translate to leadership skills (it didn't)
    \item Initially focused on technical solutions for people problems (spoiler: doesn't work)
    \item Selected Sphinx over ElasticSearch because it was "familiar" (conservative choice, suboptimal outcome)
    \item Spent more time on UML diagrams than understanding what users actually needed
    \item Implemented "comprehensive" code reviews that slowed development to a crawl
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Migrated from procedural to OOP PHP thinking it would solve architecture problems (it created new ones)
    \item Implemented "REST-compliant" API with WADL documentation (nobody used either)
    \item Built mobile portal in HTML when native apps were the obvious choice
    \item Introduced Zend Framework for "enterprise-grade" PHP development (made simple things complicated)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Leadership is about people, not technology. Conservative technology choices often age poorly. Management training exists for good reasons.

\section{Personal Project Disasters}

\subsection{2025: SchulteDev Portfolio Repository}
\textbf{The Over-Automation Trap}

Built a monorepo with AI-powered CV generation using Claude 4, sophisticated GitHub Actions, and LaTeX compilation. Created a system requiring more maintenance than manual CV updates.

\textbf{Key Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Automated CV generation for a document updated twice per year
    \item Built GitHub Actions pipeline more complex than most production deployments
    \item Spent 3 weeks automating a 30-minute manual process
    \item Created dependency on multiple external services for generating PDFs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2018: Jenkins ↔ GitHub Integration PoC}
\textbf{The Solution Nobody Asked For}

Built automatic Jenkins setup for GitHub repositories, convinced it would "revolutionize" CI/CD adoption.

\textbf{Epic Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Solved a problem that GitHub Actions would make obsolete 6 months later
    \item Used 4 different programming languages for a single integration (Java, TypeScript, Golang, Python)
    \item Built multi-tenant architecture for a tool nobody would use
    \item Convinced myself that auto-provisioning Jenkins was better than hosted CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2015: Crypto-Arbitrage Trading Bot}
\textbf{The Get-Rich-Quick Scheme}

Created automated Bitcoin arbitrage trading with machine learning, convinced I'd found the secret to easy money.

\textbf{Key Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Discovered that everyone else had the same idea (and better execution)
    \item Built ML algorithms to predict markets (markets are unpredictable, who knew?)
    \item Spent more on infrastructure than potential profits
    \item Learned that "risk-free arbitrage" includes transaction fees, slippage, and market timing
\end{itemize}

\section{Education \& Certifications}

\subsection{2004 — 2012: Diploma in Computer Science, University of Koblenz-Landau}
\textbf{The Extended Learning Experience}

\textbf{Key Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Took 8 years to complete a 5-year degree (multitasking is a myth)
    \item Worked full-time while studying full-time (learned the hard way that both suffer)
    \item Specialized in "Computational Visualistics" (sounds impressive, rarely useful)
    \item Graduated with distinction despite clearly not understanding time management
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Academic excellence doesn't translate to practical skills. Time management is more important than intelligence. Theory and practice are often unrelated.

\subsection{2003: Abitur (German High School Diploma)}
\textbf{The Gaming Addiction Origin Story}

\textbf{Key Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Discovered computer games, leading to unrealistic expectations about programming careers
    \item Taught myself PHP from a reference book (bad habits die hard)
    \item Created forums for classmates (learned that users are the hardest part of software)
    \item Advanced courses in Math and Physics (useful for understanding why software breaks)
\end{itemize}

\section{Career Breaks (Strategic Retreats)}

\subsection{April 2020 — September 2021: Parental Leave}
\textbf{The Pandemic Pivot}

Combined family time with industry-wide project slowdown. Learned that software development is surprisingly unimportant during global crises.

\textbf{Key Realizations:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Most enterprise software projects can be paused for 18 months without consequence
    \item Remote work was always possible, management just didn't trust it
    \item Parenting is harder than distributed systems architecture
    \item Work-life balance is not a technical problem requiring technical solutions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{August 2015 — December 2015: Personal Travel Break}
\textbf{The Burnout Recovery}

Extended travel period after realizing I had spent 8 years optimizing other people's problems.

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Problems exist outside software development. Most "urgent" technical issues are not actually urgent. Perspective is more valuable than any programming language.

\subsection{August 2003 — March 2004: Military Service}
\textbf{The Discipline Experiment}

Mandatory military service at Nassau-Dietz-Barracks and Hopsten airbase. Learned that hierarchy exists for reasons other than technical competence.

\textbf{Key Insights:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Following orders is a skill (useful in enterprise environments)
    \item Not everything needs to be optimized or automated
    \item Clear communication is more important than technical accuracy
    \item Some problems are solved by human discipline, not technology
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Status \& Future Disasters}

Currently contributing to German banking modernization while learning that "innovation" in banking means "doing the same thing with newer tools." Continuing to evangelize cloud-native architectures while secretly wondering if monoliths weren't so bad after all.

\textbf{Upcoming Experiments:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt]
    \item Convincing banks that Azure is simpler than on-premises infrastructure
    \item Implementing "modern" architectures for systems that have worked perfectly for 20 years
    \item Teaching enterprise developers that Kubernetes is optional
    \item Finding the perfect balance between underengineering and overengineering (spoiler: it doesn't exist)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Professional Motto:} "Making simple things complicated since 2007."
