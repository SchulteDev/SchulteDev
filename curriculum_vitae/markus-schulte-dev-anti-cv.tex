\section*{Professional Disasters Summary}

\textbf{Cloud Architect \& Software Engineer} with 18+ years of experience making expensive mistakes and learning from them. Currently serving as Cloud Architect at LBBW, where I'm contributing to "Phoenix" IT modernization by discovering all the ways cloud migration can go wrong before they do.

\textbf{My Specialty:} Turning simple requirements into complex architectures that somehow work despite my best efforts to overcomplicate them.

\section*{Greatest Failures \& Hard-Won Lessons}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{Microservices Obsession:} Split a perfectly good monolith into 8 autonomous services, creating a distributed debugging nightmare that taught me when NOT to microservice
\item \textbf{Test Coverage Addiction:} Achieved 1000+ tests with 10-minute build times, proving that you can indeed have too much of a good thing
\item \textbf{Framework Hopping:} Evaluated so many frameworks that I forgot which problem I was originally trying to solve
\item \textbf{Solo Development Syndrome:} Spent 3 years as the only developer on critical middleware, learning that bus factor of 1 is not a sustainable architecture pattern
\item \textbf{Over-Engineering Excellence:} Consistently delivered solutions that were technically impressive but operationally complex
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills That Got Me Into Trouble}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{Java (18y):} Long enough to make every possible mistake twice
\item \textbf{Golang (4y):} Fell in love with simplicity, then complicated it
\item \textbf{Microservices:} Turned simple problems into distributed ones
\item \textbf{Event-Driven Architecture:} Created event storms instead of event streams
\item \textbf{AWS/Azure/GCP:} Expensive lessons in cloud cost optimization
\item \textbf{Kubernetes:} Made simple deployments impossibly complex
\item \textbf{Testing Frameworks:} Tested everything except user patience
\item \textbf{Team Leadership:} Learned management by making every leadership mistake first
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section*{Recent Catastrophes \& Recovery Stories}

\subsection*{November 2024 — Present: Cloud Architect at LBBW}
\textbf{The Challenge:} Migrate hundreds of legacy banking applications to Azure while maintaining regulatory compliance and not breaking anything critical.

\textbf{My Contributions to Chaos:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item Initially over-engineered migration templates, then learned to embrace simplicity
\item Discovered that "Skywalker" platform wasn't production-ready by trying to use it for everything
\item Attempted to evaluate every possible cloud platform alternative before accepting "good enough"
\item Created comprehensive assessment frameworks that were too comprehensive for their own good
\item Learned that banking regulations make everything 10x more complex than expected
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lessons Learned:} Sometimes the best architecture is the one that ships, not the one that's perfect. Also, never underestimate the complexity of legacy banking systems.

\subsection*{October 2021 — December 2024: Cloud Architect at Union Investment}
\textbf{The Challenge:} Modernize a perfectly functional Liferay monolith into 8 autonomous microservices because "that's what modern architecture looks like."

\textbf{My Spectacular Failures:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item Convinced stakeholders that microfrontends were the future, then spent 2 years proving it
\item Built a custom "microfrontend-toolkit" instead of using existing solutions
\item Created an event-driven search architecture that was more complex than the original monolith
\item Achieved 1000+ tests but forgot to test if users actually wanted the features
\item Took 3 years to replace functionality that worked fine in the first place
\item Served as Product Owner without actually knowing what products users wanted
\end{itemize}

\textbf{360° Feedback Lowlights:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item "Makes technical explanations that require a PhD to understand"
\item "Brings solutions to problems we didn't know we had"
\item "Enthusiastic about architectures that exist only in whitepapers"
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What I Learned:} Just because you can distribute a system doesn't mean you should. Also, event-driven architecture is harder than it looks in conference talks.

\subsection*{December 2021 — November 2024: Middleware Engineer at Saloodo!}
\textbf{The Challenge:} Sync 10 million records between systems that were never designed to talk to each other.

\textbf{My Solo Performance:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item Accepted responsibility for critical middleware with zero backup developers
\item Discovered that "stateless" doesn't mean "problem-free"
\item Learned that malformed JSON is a feature, not a bug, in legacy systems
\item Achieved 100\% uptime through paranoid error handling and excessive logging
\item Became the single point of failure I was trying to eliminate
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lesson Learned:} Being the only person who understands the code is job security, but terrible architecture.

\section*{Historical Disasters}

\subsection*{August 2018 — October 2019: Cloud Consultant at Trusted Shops}
\textbf{My Contribution to Complexity:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item Introduced contract testing to a team that was getting along fine without it
\item Migrated from JavaEE6 to microservices, creating 13 repositories where 1 used to suffice
\item Implemented AWS Lambda templates that were more complex than the applications they replaced
\item Conducted load testing that revealed problems we didn't know we wanted to solve
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{October 2016 — September 2017: Senior Engineer at toom Baumarkt}
\textbf{Quality Leadership Gone Wrong:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item Led "quality initiatives" that made simple tasks require 3 approval stages
\item Introduced so many testing tools that developers spent more time configuring than coding
\item Achieved 70\% test performance improvement by making tests so complex they barely tested anything
\item Became the "quality guy" everyone avoided in the hallway
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{August 2007 — June 2014: PHP Developer at wer-kennt-wen}
\textbf{Early Career Disasters:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item Convinced management to make me Head of Development at age 23 (they learned their lesson)
\item Migrated from working PHP to "better" architecture that required constant maintenance
\item Implemented security measures so complex that legitimate users couldn't log in
\item Scaled to 9 million users just in time for the platform to shut down
\item Learned that being technically right doesn't make you managerially effective
\end{itemize}

\section*{Personal Project Failures}

\subsection*{2016-2024: Atlassian Marketplace Add-ons}
Built Java add-ons for Bamboo Server that integrated code quality metrics. The failure? Bamboo Server was discontinued shortly after I achieved market success. Learned that betting on deprecated technology is a reliable way to kill a profitable business.

\subsection*{2018: Jenkins ↔ GitHub Integration}
Created sophisticated multi-tenant architecture for automatically setting up Jenkins for GitHub repos. The failure? GitHub Actions launched 6 months later, making my solution obsolete before it launched. Learned that timing is everything in technology.

\subsection*{2015: Crypto-Arbitrage Trading Bot}
Built automated Bitcoin trading with machine learning. The failure? Spent more on infrastructure than the bot ever earned. Learned that being technically clever doesn't guarantee profitability.

\section*{Educational Failures}

\subsection*{2004-2012: Computer Science Diploma, University of Koblenz-Landau}
\textbf{The Failure:} Took 8 years to complete a 4-year degree because I was too busy working to focus on studying.

\textbf{The Lesson:} Sometimes real-world experience is more valuable than academic efficiency, but explaining the gap in your timeline gets old fast.

\textbf{Grade:} Magna cum laude (proving that persistence beats perfection)

\subsection*{2003: Abitur}
\textbf{The Failure:} Chose Computer Visualistics thinking it would be about video games. Learned that academic computer graphics involves more mathematics than fun.

\section*{Skills I Wish I'd Never Learned}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item \textbf{Terraform:} Turned infrastructure into code, then spent time debugging both
\item \textbf{Kubernetes:} Made simple deployments require YAML engineering degrees
\item \textbf{Event Sourcing:} Created audit trails that audited everything except user satisfaction
\item \textbf{Contract Testing:} Tested interfaces that nobody used the way we tested them
\item \textbf{Microservices:} Distributed monoliths across networks, called it "architecture"
\item \textbf{Serverless:} Eliminated servers, added vendor lock-in and cold start problems
\item \textbf{Clean Code:} Made simple code so clean it required documentation to understand
\item \textbf{Agile Methodologies:} Facilitated ceremonies that took longer than the work
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section*{Career Breaks (Strategic Retreats)}

\subsection*{April 2020 — September 2021: Parental Leave}
\textbf{Official Reason:} Pandemic lockdowns and family time.\\
\textbf{Real Reason:} Needed 18 months to recover from over-engineering Union Investment's architecture.

\subsection*{August 2015 — December 2015: "Travel Break"}
\textbf{Official Reason:} Cultural exploration and personal growth.\\
\textbf{Real Reason:} Crypto trading bot failure required strategic retreat from technology.

\subsection*{August 2003 — March 2004: Military Service}
\textbf{Official Reason:} Mandatory service in German Air Force.\\
\textbf{Real Reason:} Last chance to follow orders instead of making architectural decisions.

\section*{Current Status \& Future Failures}

Currently serving as Cloud Architect at LBBW, where I'm learning that banking regulations make every technical decision 10x more complex than necessary. My latest challenge is convincing stakeholders that "cloud-native" doesn't mean "automatically better."

\textbf{Looking Forward:} I'm excited to continue my career of turning simple problems into complex solutions, preferably with even more acronyms and frameworks than before.
