\section*{The Honest Summary}

18+ years of writing bugs in Java, 11+ years convincing clients my architectural drawings mean something, and a persistent belief that ``simple'' solutions exist (spoiler: they don't). Currently helping LBBW catalog hundreds of legacy applications while pretending R-methodology is more than glorified Excel sheets. Previously spent 3+ years at Union Investment proving that microfrontends are just iframes with extra steps. Successfully reduced deployment times from days to minutes -- then spent those saved minutes in architecture meetings.

\section*{Greatest Hits (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Technical Debt)}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item \textbf{Saved 60 person-days} by skipping proper evaluation and going with my gut on Web Components. Still waiting for karma to catch up.
\item \textbf{Built a 9M+ user social platform} that died in 2014. Facebook sends their regards.
\item \textbf{Achieved 99.9\% uptime} at Saloodo! by writing so many error handlers that even malformed JSON became a feature.
\item \textbf{Reduced test execution time by 70\%} at toom, then watched teams add more tests until builds were slow again.
\item \textbf{Created Bamboo add-ons} with 83 customers who probably switched to GitHub Actions by now.
\item \textbf{Led teams of 5-9 developers} using laissez-faire style (fancy way of saying ``please just get it done'').
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills I Claim to Have (Proficiency Inversely Proportional to Confidence)}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lX@{}}
\textbf{Languages I Debug In:} & Java (18y of NullPointerExceptions), Golang (4y of ``nil is not null''), PHP (8y, we don't talk about it) \\[3pt]
\textbf{Clouds I've Gotten Lost In:} & AWS (where everything has 3 names), Azure (Microsoft's revenge), GCP (the other one) \\[3pt]
\textbf{Architectures I Draw:} & Microservices (distributed monoliths), Event-driven (eventual consistency nightmares), SCS (because we needed another acronym) \\[3pt]
\textbf{Things I Containerize:} & Docker (``it works on my machine'' as a service), Kubernetes (complexity addiction support group member) \\[3pt]
\textbf{Testing Philosophies:} & Test Pyramid (more like test ice cream cone), Contract Testing (trust but verify but test anyway) \\[3pt]
\textbf{Agile Ceremonies:} & Scrum Master by accident, Product Owner by necessity, Developer by choice \\[3pt]
\textbf{Documentation:} & Confluence (where documentation goes to die), README files (always outdated), Architecture diagrams (fiction)

\section*{Recent Adventures in Over-Engineering}

\subsection*{Cloud Architect at LBBW (Nov 2024 -- Present)}
\textit{Teaching a German state bank that ``Phoenix'' is just a fancy name for ``please migrate everything''}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item Cataloging hundreds of legacy apps using ``R-methodology'' -- basically asking ``Rehost, Refactor, or Retire?'' while everyone answers ``Retain''
\item Evaluating Elastisys Welkin because apparently one cloud platform (Skywalker) isn't complex enough
\item Writing Solution Design Templates that will be ignored in favor of ``let's just lift-and-shift''
\item Discovering the Skywalker platform is production-unused -- essentially architecting for a ghost town
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cloud Architect at Union Investment (Oct 2021 -- Dec 2024)}
\textit{3+ years proving that Self-contained Systems are just microservices in denial}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item Decomposed monolith into 8 domains, each now maintaining their own bugs independently
\item Implemented microfrontends using Web Components -- because regular iframes weren't trendy enough
\item Built event-driven architecture where ``eventual consistency'' means ``eventually someone will notice the data mismatch''
\item Chose Algolia over ElasticSearch, saving operational overhead but adding ``explain Algolia pricing'' to my nightmares
\item Led team with 360Â° feedback revealing I explain things too technically (guilty as charged)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Middleware Engineer at Saloodo!/DHL (Dec 2021 -- Nov 2024)}
\textit{Part-time Golang adventure: Building unnecessary middleware because ``we've always done it this way''}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item Sole developer for middleware that shouldn't exist -- AWS Lambda would've been simpler, cheaper, and faster
\item Wrote error handlers for Saloodo's ``creative'' database schemas (malformed JSON is apparently a valid datatype)
\item Achieved 100\% uptime by making the service so fault-tolerant it could survive the heat death of the universe
\item Synchronized 10 million records periodically, because real-time eventing was ``too complicated''
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cloud Consultant at Trusted Shops (Aug 2018 -- Oct 2019)}
\textit{First real microservices architecture -- discovered why people complain about them}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item Witnessed microservices reality: simple changes requiring updates to 12 services and 3 prayer sessions
\item Implemented Pact contract testing after learning that ``it worked in dev'' isn't a valid integration strategy
\item Migrated JavaEE6 monolith to AWS Lambda, trading one complexity for another
\item Taught teams that Terraform isn't magic, it's just infrastructure bugs as code
\end{itemize}

\section*{Previous Battles with Legacy Systems}

\subsection*{Senior Engineer at toom Baumarkt (Oct 2016 -- Sep 2017)}
\textit{Where I learned Kubernetes is designed by and for masochists}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item First Kubernetes encounter -- concluded it's too complex for both ops and dev teams (still believe this)
\item Reduced E2E test time by 70\%, giving developers more time to write flaky tests
\item Led cross-team quality initiatives, discovering ``quality'' means different things to different teams
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Creator of Bamboo Add-ons (Jun 2016 -- Dec 2023)}
\textit{7-year journey in maintaining software for a dying CI/CD platform}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item Built commercial add-ons for Atlassian Bamboo, a product even Atlassian barely remembers
\item 83 customers worldwide who probably curse my name during every Bamboo upgrade
\item Proved you can build a business on technical debt integration tools
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Head of Development at werkenntwen (Aug 2007 -- Jun 2014)}
\textit{Built Germany's ``other'' social network -- the one that lost to Facebook}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item Scaled platform to 9M+ users, then watched it die when Facebook remembered Germany exists
\item Promoted to Head of Development without management experience -- learned that technical skills != leadership skills
\item Chose Sphinx over ElasticSearch because it seemed ``simpler'' -- later migrated to ElasticSearch anyway
\item Discovered my leadership style: laissez-faire (French for ``I trust you know what you're doing'')
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Brief Mentions of Other Adventures:} Senior JavaEE Developer at Allianz (2017-2018) where CloudFoundry felt revolutionary; Cloud Consultant at Sedo (2020) consolidating services because someone finally asked ``why do we have three?''; Various freelance projects (2014-2016) spreading Jenkins CI like it was the gospel, back when ``DevOps'' meant ``the developer who knows SSH''.

\section*{Personal Projects (Or: What I Do Instead of Having Hobbies)}

\subsection*{ConversationalAI4J (2025)}
Built a Java library for voice-enabled AI conversations because apparently typing is too mainstream. Uses Whisper.cpp and Piper TTS to let you argue with LLMs verbally. Currently teaching it to understand my German accent.

\subsection*{AI Document Processing (2025)}
Created a CLI tool using Azure Document Intelligence for German tax software because manually entering receipts builds character, but I'm lazy. Turns out AI is better at reading my receipts than I am.

\subsection*{Crypto Trading Bot (2015)}
Built Bitcoin arbitrage bot with machine learning during the crypto bubble. The bot worked perfectly; the markets didn't. Learned that ``past performance'' really doesn't indicate future results.

\section*{Academic Credentials}

\subsection*{Diplom in Computer Science, University of Koblenz-Landau (2004 -- 2012)}
Took 8 years to complete because I discovered you could get paid to write code instead of paying to learn it. Graduated magna cum laude, which roughly translates to ``spent too much time perfecting code that professors would never run''. Specialized in Computational Visualistics -- fancy term for ``making things look pretty while being computationally expensive''.

\subsection*{Java SE 8 Certification (2018)}
Scored 93/100 on IKM test, placing in 88th percentile. Still regularly Google ``Java stream API examples''.

\subsection*{StackOverflow Reputation: 4000+}
Proof that I've successfully debugged other people's NullPointerExceptions while procrastinating on my own.

\section*{Additional Skills That Sound Impressive}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=1pt]
\item \textbf{Meeting Survival:} Can stay awake during 3-hour architecture reviews where everyone agrees but nothing gets decided
\item \textbf{Buzzword Bingo:} Fluent in ``synergy,'' ``paradigm shift,'' and ``digital transformation'' without laughing
\item \textbf{Time Estimation:} Consistently multiply developer estimates by 3, still occasionally optimistic
\item \textbf{Code Review Diplomacy:} Expert at writing ``have you considered...'' instead of ``what were you thinking?''
\item \textbf{Stack Overflow:} Can find the one answer from 2013 that actually works, ignore the 47 marked as correct
\item \textbf{Git Commit Messages:} Started with good intentions, now just trying to avoid ``fix stuff''
\item \textbf{Architecture Diagrams:} Can draw boxes and arrows that look important but commit to nothing
\end{itemize}

\section*{Career Breaks (When I Remembered Life Exists Outside IDEs)}

\textbf{Parental Leave (Apr 2020 -- Sep 2021):} COVID-19 lockdown parenting -- discovered that debugging toddler tantrums is harder than debugging production systems. No rollback feature available.

\textbf{Travel Break (Aug -- Dec 2015):} Traveled the world to ``find myself,'' found WiFi passwords instead. Confirmed that bugs are universal, only the error messages change languages.

\textbf{Military Service (Aug 2003 -- Mar 2004):} Mandatory German military service. Learned that real-time systems in fighter jets have slightly different uptime requirements than web apps.

All failures, lessons learned, and questionable architectural decisions are 100\% genuine and human-made. The humor was added to cope with the trauma of explaining microservices to stakeholders who still think ``the cloud'' is just someone else's computer. Wait, it actually is.}}
