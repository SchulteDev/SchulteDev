Letter of recommendation Markus Schulte

Dear Sir or Madam,

Mr Schulte has been working as a freelancer for our company since January 2014.

At dailypresent, he is mainly responsible for the development of the PHP backend
and deals with the REST-API for connecting the dailypresent-
smartphone clients.

His way of working is consistently object-orientated and sustainable, while
uses the latest PHP(5.4) language features. In particular, the
implementation is characterised by continuous refactoring. Testing is carried out with the help of PHPUnit at.
Mr Schulte also uses software metrics (e.g. CodeCoverage) and PHPUnit expert knowledge (e.g. mocking).

MySQL is used as the database, with memcache also being used at scaling-critical
points. Git is used for version management.
It is part of the tasks to integrate facebook-graph-api and Amazon Webservices
(AWS). In the dailypresent MVC web application, Mr
Schulte also takes on smaller tasks in the view and implements them in Smarty, while
he also demonstrates his knowledge of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery.
Software development at dailyprent is agile, and Mr Schulte is part of this
process, from requirements analysis to operation and maintenance. Mr
Schulte works independently and plays an important role in communication within
development.

In addition, Mr Schulte provides advice on IT issues and supports the
technical management with his expert knowledge on many technical questions.

Mr Schulte is very conscientious and his delivered work results meet
the highest quality standards. The speed of development and the
communication with other team members are always to our complete
satisfaction.

Yours sincerely
Fabian Jager (CTO and authorised signatory of dailypresent GmbH)
