Letter of recommendation for Markus Schulte

Dear Sir or Madam,

AffiliCon GmbH is a payment provider for numerous large and small providers in the
area of internet marketing products, seminar providers and download products. We offer our customers a payment form optimised for maximum conversion with various
payment methods. The administration tool for merchants makes it quick and easy to test new products
and customise the payment form according to your wishes.

As part of the improvement of our software quality and to automate our existing
component tests, we were looking for a freelancer for the installation and basic configuration
of a continuous integration server.

Mr Schulte recommended the Jenkins continuous integration server for AffiliCon GmbH.
The Jenkins server was installed and set up in a virtual environment. Where necessary, he further developed the PHP application to meet the new requirements of a CI -
environment. The Jenkins instance is now used to constantly monitor the
test status of the affilicon software and also provides metrics relating to software
quality.

His technical knowledge of PHP, Java and code metrics is outstanding. Mr
Schulte has worked very
sustainably thanks to his numerous constructive suggestions for test development.
We were able to benefit from his extensive experience and excellent training.
Mr Schulte completed all the tasks we requested to our complete satisfaction.

In addition to his impeccable professional qualifications, Mr Schulte is characterised by his friendliness
and his ability to work in a team. I consider him to be an excellent software developer who can be integrated very
quickly into existing teams.

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have by telephone.

Yours sincerely,
Dieter Granitzki
CTO-AffiliCon GmbH
