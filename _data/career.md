### August 2007 — June 2014: PHP Developer and Head of Development at werkenntwen

*wer-kennt-wen.de (lemonline media ltd. / werkenntwen GmbH) | Permanent Position*

**Company Context:**

- One of Germany's largest social networks with 9+ million members
- Platform for connecting users and finding old acquaintances
- Founded October 2006, acquired by RTL interactive (RTL Deutschland media group) in February 2009
- Company ceased operations June 30, 2014

**Career Path:**

- PHP Developer (Aug 2007 — Oct 2008)
- Head of Development (Oct 2008 — Mar 2010)
- Backend Developer (Apr 2010 — Jun 30 2014)

**Key Development Contributions:**

  ElasticSearch due to familiarity, despite ElasticSearch offering more advanced features that
  seemed exotic at the time. This conservative choice proved suboptimal as ElasticSearch's feature
  set became industry standard. The platform later migrated from Sphinx to ElasticSearch during my
  return as Backend Developer, validating that the more innovative choice would have been better
  long-term.

subjects and took math and physics as advanced courses in high school.

I had my first contact with IT during my school years. In the sixth grade, I attended a typing
course. Unfortunately, this was my last contact with PCs at school. Later, in the years 2000-2003, I
taught myself PHP using a PHP reference. Equipped with this knowledge, I created homepages including
a forum for my friend group and later for my graduating class.

Typically, I also discovered computer games for myself. This led to my decision to study Computer
Visualistics in Koblenz.
