Today's agenda includes a focus on my professional portfolio which is present in this project
"SchulteDev".
I would be very grateful for your assistance in enhancing my professional development.

Please familiarise yourself with the subject by reading the README_repository.md document, and by
understanding the subprojects _data/, curriculum_vitae/ and schulte-development_de/.
It is also important to be familiar with the GitHub actions in the .github/ directory. I have no
requirement for a summary of the project or its subprojects; I simply need you to become acquainted
with them.
