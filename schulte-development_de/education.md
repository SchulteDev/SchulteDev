# University Education - Diplom Computer Science

**University of Koblenz-Landau, Campus Koblenz** • 2004 — 2012

- **Program:** Diplom Computer Science in Computational Visualistics (Computervisualistik)
  - The [German Diplom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom) degree is equivalent to a 
    Master of Science
- **Final Grade:** Distinction (German "mit Auszeichnung", magna cum laude equivalent)
  - [Certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SchulteDev/SchulteDev/refs/heads/main/_data/credentials/2012_Markus%20Schulte%20Diploma%20computer%20science%20certificate%20Diplom%20Informatik.pdf)

Computational Visualistics combines computer science with visual computing, covering areas such as:

- Advanced algorithms and data structures
- Software engineering
- IT architecture
- Computer graphics and visualization
- Image processing and computer vision
- Human-computer interaction
- Mathematical foundations

This interdisciplinary program provided a strong foundation in both theoretical computer science and
practical visual computing applications, which continues to inform my approach to modern software
architecture and user experience design.

# Continuous Learning

Throughout my 18+ year career, I've maintained a commitment to continuous learning through:

- Industry conferences and workshops
- Cloud platform certifications (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Open source contributions and community engagement
- Technical leadership roles that require staying current with emerging technologies
